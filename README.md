> Today I Learned
Inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn by pairing with
smart people at [Hashrocket](http://hashrocket.com/).
